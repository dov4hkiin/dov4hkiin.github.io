<h2>One Punch Man History</h2>

<p><a href="https://google.ca">Lorem ipsum</a>

<p>One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン Hepburn: Wanpanman) is an ongoing Japanese webcomic created by an author using the pseudonym ONE, which began publication in 2009. The series quickly went viral, surpassing 7.9 million hits in June 2012. The name is a play on the long-running children's character Anpanman, as the word punch (パンチ panchi) is not usually shortened to pan (パン).</p>

A digital manga remake of the series, illustrated by Yusuke Murata, began publication on Shueisha's Young Jump Web Comics website in 2012. Viz Media has licensed the remake for English serialization in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine. In March 2015, it was announced that an anime adaptation had been green-lit and began airing in October 2015.</p>
